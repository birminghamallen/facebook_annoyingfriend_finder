# Facebook Annoying Friend Finder
##*A Facebook extension that is used to compile a group of annoying friends, and be able to remove them all as a mass*

I want to create an algorithim that loops through all of the users friends, and checks to see how often they post, how active they are, how many average likes they get on their pictures, how many times you like there photos, and anything else you can think of. Basically, I want this to be a tool for those who have an excessive amount of friends. When the annoying friends are compiled there will be an option to unselect friends that you still don't want to delete.
